**Comeback** - **Project restoration in one command, auto open everything!** comeback helps you open your project's ide/browser/terminal (and more!) all at once - so you wouldn't have to do it manually. Get right back to the business of actually developing. 

![comeback_intro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1269911/54078611-ab3dd680-42d3-11e9-8066-fabcda7212ac.gif)

## How much time does this save?
If it takes you an average of 2 minutes to open all of your project's tools, then you waste about 8.5 hours a year per project, not to mention the friction it adds to start really working :O


## Example
1) In the project directory, we have `.comeback` recipe:
```json
[  
   {  
      "vscode": {  
         "cwd": "~/dev/myproject"
      }
   },
   {  
      "chrome": {  
         "url": "http://localhost:8080/"
      }
   }
]
```
2) Open a terminal in the project dir and run `comeback`  
> *This .comeback recipe will open vscode in the `~/dev/myproject` path, and open chrome at the `http://localhost:8080/` url.*
 
## How to run locally (current install)
#### Local:
`pipenv shell`  
`pipenv install -e .`  
`comeback --help`  
`cd example`  
`comeback # and see the magic`  
#### Global (via pip):
`pip install -e /path/to/comeback`  
(the directory must have the setup.py file in it)  

> Sometimes on linux you may need to configure site-pacakges to be in path like so:  
`export PATH="$PATH:~/path/to/python/site-packages"`

## Why not bash/batch?
- It isn't cross-platform.
- It's more abstract to interact with your project's programs.
- With more plugins added every day interacting with programs is much easier. 
  - Why write your own when it's done for you? (DRY)

## How to write a plugin
1) Create a new directory in `comeback/plugins` with the name of the program you want to interact with.
2) Add a `__init__.py` file in that directory
3) Create a `main.py` file with:
	- `run_plugin(arg0, arg1...)` - start the plugin, make sure this is cross-platform.  
	
You may want to see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/agamm/comeback/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you decide to add a plugin.

## Ideas of `.comeback` recipes for each kind of developer:
- comeback for frontend developers: 
    - open chrome with live reload 
    - open sublime in the specific project path
    - open a terminal with `npm run start`
- comeback for backend developers:
    - open goland in the specific project path
    - open postman with the project-specific routes
    - open a terminal and run the server
- comeback for game developers:
    - open the ide in the specific project path
    - open chrome with the relevant docs
    - open the terminal to view logs
- comeback for hackers:
    - open tmux with the relevant sessions
    - open FF
    - open IDA

## Notes
 - Use application specific settings temporarily to open the application in the desired state (thanks @MaorCore)
 - Tests, tests and tests.
 
## Testing
`pytest tests`  
Coverage:  
`pytest --cov=comeback tests` (see [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov))
